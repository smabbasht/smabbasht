### Hello I'm @smabbasht (Syed M. Abbas Haider T.) 👋
I am a Data Engineer working in a FinTech using Rust 🦀 and Go 🐹 at work for building fast and secure data pipelines and distributed system software for realtime applications and engines. <br>I use JAX/Python 🐍 for my machine learning research projects along with Pyro/Numpyro.

I am a Computer Science graduate from Habib University 🎓, interested in data science 📊, operating systems 🖥️, low-level programming 🔧, and realtime applications ⏱️.

I love to talk about Linux 🐧, Vim 🖋️, and i3wm 🖥️, and of course Rust 🦀 and Go 🐹.
